This is a view booster for youtube, every 30 to 60 it will change video for the next one.
Youtube it's changing from time to time, 
and they might stop counting as a view after 4-5 times within 24 hours.
But let's find out !

As this boost will run forever(as long as you wish), you will need a server running on your computer 
and the app/browser app or postman for the developpers 

This is the web app README :

1) Make/Choose a YT playlist 
2) Clone the repository and install the web app or go directly to the website/deploy 
3) Install it or use it in the browser
4) Find your Chrome path on your computer
5) Install the server, find the repository here
